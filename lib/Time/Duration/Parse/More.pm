=head1 NAME

Time::Duration::Parse::More - parse natural language time duration expressions

=head1 VERSION

version 0.006

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Time::Duration::Parse::More;

    my ($seconds);
    $seconds = parse_duration('1 minute, 30 seconds'); ## 90
    $seconds = parse_duration('1 minute plus 15 seconds'); ## 75
    $seconds = parse_duration('1 minute minus 15 seconds'); ## 45
    $seconds = parse_duration('1 day minus 2.5 hours and 10 minutes plus 15 seconds'); ## 76815
    $seconds = parse_duration('minus 15 seconds'); ## -15
    $seconds = parse_duration('midnight'); ## it depends :)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module parses a limited set of natural language expressions and
converts them into seconds.

It is backwards compatible with L<Time::Duration::Parse> (passes the
same test cases), but adds more expressions and memoization.

At the moment, the module is limited to english language expressions.

=head2 Rules

The following rules are used to parse the expressions:

=over 4

=item *

horizantal white-space, commas and the token I<and> are ignored;

=item *

an expresion in the form C<< N factor >> is translated to
C<< N * factor_in_seconds >>. C<factor> is optional, defaults to I<seconds>.
Negative and fractional values of C<N> are suported. Singular, plural
and single letter versions of C<factor> are understood. All are
case-insensitive B<except> the single letter versions;

=item *

expressions in the form C<hh:mm:ss>, C<hh:mm>, and C<XhYmZs> (any order,
all parts optional) are also supported;

=item *

the tokens I<plus> or I<minus> change the signal of the expressions that
follow them;

=item *

the final value is the sum of all the expressions
taking in account the sign defined by the previous rule.

=back

The hard-coded 'midnight' expression is also understood and returns the
number of seconds up to 00::00:00 of the next day.

=head2 Factors

The following factors are understood, with the corresponding value in seconds between parentesis:

=over 4

=item *

seconds (1): s, second, seconds, sec, and secs;

=item *

minutes (60): m, minute, minutes, min, and mins;

=item *

hours (60 * minutes factor): h, hr, hour, and hours;

=item *

days (24 * hours factor): d, day, and days;

=item *

weeks (7 * days factor): w, week, and weeks;

=item *

months (30 * days factor): M (note the case), month and months;

=item *

years (365 * days factor): y, year, and years;

=back

=encoding utf8

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 parse_duration

    $seconds = parse_duration($expression);

Given an C<$expression> in natural lanaguage returns the number of
seconds it represents. This result, with the exception of the
'midnight' expression, is cached so future calls with the same
expression will be faster.

If the expression cannot be parsed, C<parse_duration> will croak.

=head2 parse_duration_nc

Same as L</parse_duration>, but the result will not be cached.

=head1 HISTORY

This module started as a private module for a closed-source project. I
started to release it as C<Time::Delta> when I discovered
L<Time::Duration::Parse>. I updated the API to match it, and added my
own improvements. This is the result.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Time::Duration::Parse> and L<Time::Duration>.
